# Project 2: Modeling Data with Cassandra
## Summary of the project
Sparkify wants to analize their data of songs and the user activity in the platform. We decided to create with their data a denormalized Cassandra schema for doing analytics modeling the information in the correct way so we can query data in a fast way and generate aggregations with the data. In the project we converted CSV files into a denormalizec table and load it into 3 Cassandra tables for doing queries.
## How to run?
Run the Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb file with Jupyter Notebooks and enjoy!
## Explanation of each file
- event_data: Folder with the CSV of the data of the events in the app.
- Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the develop of the project.
- event_datafile_new.csv: Generated CSV file with all the events information.
- images: Images used to ilustrate in the Jupyter notebook
